## Project Description

- For our final project, we are trying to answer what effect, if any, the weather has on outgoing flights. More specifically we are interested in the weather in Seattle and its effect on flights leaving SeaTac. We believe this to be an important topic as thousands of people fly through Seattle everyday, and as all of us as residents know Seattle's weather can be both variable and rainy. If we were be able to inform either the populace of Seattle or the organization of SeaTac with this information, the hope would be that individuals would be more prepared for their journeys, and that SeaTac can react accordingly.

- The specific question we hope to answer with this data is, given a particular day at SeaTac International Airport, can we predict the average departure delay for all flights based upon the weather? Our _null hypothesis_ would be: there is no relationship between the average daily departure delay at SeaTac and the weather at SeaTac. Conversely, our _alternative hypothesis_ would be: there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay at SeaTac and the weather at SeaTac.

- To estimate the average departure delay at SeaTac International Airport (SEA), two datasets 1) flight delay data at SEA and 2) weather data of SEA will be used. From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/predicting-flight-delays-tutorial/data), we acquired the 2015 flight delays and cancellations dataset. This dataset contains three tables including the list of airlines, airports and the actual flights. From [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/), we downloaded the weather data for the year of 2015 that is recorded by weather station at Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA).
