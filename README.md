## Project Description

- For our final project, we are trying to answer what effect, if any, the weather has on outgoing flights. More specifically we are interested in the weather in Seattle and its effect on flights leaving SeaTac. We believe this to be an important topic as thousands of people fly through Seattle everyday, and as all of us as residents know Seattle's weather can be both variable and rainy. If we were be able to inform either the populace of Seattle or the organization of SeaTac with this information, the hope would be that individuals would be more prepared for their journeys, and that SeaTac can react accordingly. 

- Flight delays can have costly consequences. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, flight delays have a 40.7 billion dollar impact. Additionally, all of that time planes spend on the tarmac results in excess fuel being used and more emissions being released (Fleurquin). Flight delays also result in significant disruptions to aviation safety and the decreased traffic results in losses for the airlines (Gao, 68). Flight delays also cause passengers to prefer other airlines if they experience delays with a certain carrier (Tae-Hwee Lee, 277). Causes of flight delays can range from the unpreventable, severe weather (Gao, 68), to the preventable, crew mishaps and flight order rotation (Fleurquin).

- The specific question we hope to answer with this data is, given a particular day at SeaTac International Airport, can we predict the average departure delay for all flights based upon the weather? Our _null hypothesis_ would be: there is no relationship between the average daily departure delay at SeaTac and the weather at SeaTac. Conversely, our _alternate hypothesis_ would be: there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay at SeaTac and the weather at SeaTac.
